# Nuntius Go

Nuntius is an interactive anonymous messaging webapp with a dare game. Built with Go, HTMX, Templ and PostgresQL. This is a clone of the [original nuntius](https://github.com/chizidotdev/nuntius) built with NextJS...
Goal of this project was to experiment with the golang, htmx and templ stack.

### Explored Features
- Templ + HTMX for server side rendering and client side interactivity
- Google oauth2
- Session storage with gin and postgres
- Send and receive anonymous messages
- Clean architecture pattern

## Development

Run the following command to start the server
```bash
docker compose up
```
Navigate to `localhost:8080` on your browser to view the app
